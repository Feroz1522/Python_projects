print("""One fine morning, as he hauled in his nets, something extraordinary tugged at his line. 
With a mighty heave, he reeled it in, revealing a shimmering, jewel-encrusted fish.
 Its scales sparkled with every color of the rainbow, and its eyes held a mysterious, knowing gleam.""")

print(f'The fish spoke in a soft, melodious voice, "{ch_name}, I am {fish_name}, the Guardian of the Deep.\nI have chosen you to be my protector."')

print("and the sea thrives because of your stewardship. It is time for me to return to the depths,")
print(" but my magic will always be with you.\"")

print(f"With those words, the radiant fish disappeared beneath the waves, leaving {ch_name} with a heart full of gratitude.")
